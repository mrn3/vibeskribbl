## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/analytics`

Query parameters:
- `type=overview` - Returns overall game statistics
- `type=players` - Returns player performance data
- `type=response-times` - Returns response time chart data
- `type=all-games` - Returns raw game data
- `type=generate-sample` - Generates sample data for testing

### DELETE `/api/analytics`
Clears all analytics data (useful for testing/reset)

## Data Models

### GameAnalytics
```typescript
interface GameAnalytics {
  gameId: string;
  roomId: string;
  startTime: number;
  endTime?: number;
  totalRounds: number;
  totalPlayers: number;
  winner?: Player;
  rounds: RoundAnalytics[];
}
```

### RoundAnalytics
```typescript
interface RoundAnalytics {
  gameId: string;
  roundNumber: number;
  word: string;
  drawerId: string;
  drawerName: string;
  roundDuration: number;
  totalPlayers: number;
  playersWhoGuessed: number;
  averageGuessTime: number;
  fastestGuessTime: number;
  slowestGuessTime: number;
  guesses: PlayerGuessAnalytics[];
}
```

### PlayerGuessAnalytics
```typescript
interface PlayerGuessAnalytics {
  playerId: string;
  playerName: string;
  word: string;
  guessTime: number;
  pointsEarned: number;
  roundNumber: number;
  gameId: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/analytics` from the main page
2. Click "View Analytics" link on the homepage
3. Direct URL: `http://localhost:3001/analytics`

### Generating Sample Data
For testing purposes, click the "Generate Sample Data" button on the analytics page. This creates:
- 3 sample games with 4 players each
- 3 rounds per game with realistic response times
- Varied scoring patterns and word selections

### Real Game Data
Analytics are automatically collected during actual gameplay:
- Data collection starts when a game begins
- Round analytics track each drawing/guessing phase
- Player response times are measured from round start to correct guess
- Game completion triggers final analytics processing

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection
- **Server-side tracking**: Analytics collection integrated into socket server
- **Real-time processing**: Statistics calculated as games progress
- **In-memory storage**: Current implementation uses Map-based storage
- **Extensible design**: Easy to add database persistence

### Chart Rendering
- **Custom Canvas Charts**: HTML5 Canvas-based chart components
- **No external dependencies**: Lightweight implementation
- **Responsive design**: Charts adapt to different screen sizes

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient data structures**: Optimized for real-time updates
- **Minimal overhead**: Analytics collection doesn't impact game performance
- **Scalable architecture**: Ready for database integration

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Database persistence**: PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration
- **Advanced filtering**: Date ranges, player groups, game types
- **Export functionality**: CSV/JSON data export
- **Real-time updates**: Live dashboard updates during games
- **Comparative analytics**: Player vs. player comparisons
- **Trend analysis**: Performance trends over time

### Potential Metrics
- **Drawing quality scores**: Based on guess success rates
- **Word difficulty ratings**: Dynamic difficulty based on guess times
- **Player skill levels**: Calculated from performance history
- **Room analytics**: Performance by room/group
- **Time-based patterns**: Peak playing times, session lengths
