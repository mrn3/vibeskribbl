Meeting notes:
Bug Fixes and Improvements: 
Matt, Tom, and Irek discussed various bugs and improvements in their project, including fixing a loophole that allowed repeated guesses and ensuring the game doesn’t switch turns prematurely. They also noted issues with color display and scoring inconsistencies.
	Repeated Guesses Loophole: Matt confirmed that he closed the loophole that allowed repeated guesses in the game. This fix was implemented in the last game update, ensuring that players cannot exploit this issue anymore.
	Turn Switching Bug: Tom and Irek discussed a bug where the game switches turns prematurely. This issue was identified when Tom's turn was interrupted, and it switched to another player. Matt acknowledged this as a bug that needs to be reported and fixed.
	Color Display Issues: Craig and Tom noted inconsistencies in the color display during the game. Craig mentioned seeing different colors on his screen compared to others, indicating a bug in the color rendering system. Matt suggested filing a bug report for this issue.
	Scoring Inconsistencies: Irek pointed out discrepancies in the scoring system, where the chat showed different scores compared to the game interface. This inconsistency needs to be addressed to ensure accurate score tracking.
Feature Requests: 
Tom and Matt suggested several feature requests, including adding a pause between rounds, displaying round summaries, and providing analytics and reports on player performance. They also discussed the need for more colors in the drawing palette.
	Pause Between Rounds: Tom suggested adding a pause between rounds to give players a moment to prepare for the next round. This pause would include a modal displaying the end of the previous round and the start of the next round.
	Round Summaries: Matt proposed displaying round summaries to all players while someone is choosing a word. This feature would show scores and key events from the last round, enhancing the game experience.
	Player Performance Analytics: Tom and Matt discussed the idea of providing analytics and reports on player performance. These reports could include response times, accuracy, and other metrics to help players understand and improve their gameplay.
	Additional Colors: Tom emphasized the need for more colors in the drawing palette, particularly brown, to allow for more accurate and diverse drawings. Matt agreed that adding more colors would be a simple yet effective improvement.
AI Coding Tools: 
Matt and Tom compared their experiences with different AI coding tools, specifically Augment and Cursor. Matt expressed a preference for Augment due to its server-side optimizations and remote agent mode, which he found more efficient and productive.
	Augment vs. Cursor: Matt shared his preference for Augment over Cursor, highlighting Augment's server-side optimizations and remote agent mode. He found Augment to be more efficient and productive, particularly for tasks that benefit from server-side processing.
	Server-Side Optimizations: Matt explained that Augment's server-side optimizations allow for better performance and less client-side processing. This results in a smoother and more efficient coding experience.
	Remote Agent Mode: Matt praised Augment's remote agent mode, which enables users to delegate tasks to the server, reducing the need to wait for local processing. This feature enhances productivity by allowing users to focus on other tasks while the server handles complex operations.
	AI Coding Efficiency: Matt noted that AI coding tools have reached a point where they significantly reduce coding time. He mentioned that six months ago, AI coding might have taken longer than manual coding, but now it offers substantial time savings and improved productivity.
Upcoming Architecture Meeting: 
Tom announced that during the upcoming architecture meeting on Monday, they will spend 20 minutes discussing the recent AI concept acceptance and its implications for their software’s user experience. This presentation is expected to provide insights into how AI will influence their software’s future development.
	AI Concept Acceptance: Tom mentioned that the upcoming architecture meeting will include a 20-minute discussion on the recent AI concept acceptance. This discussion will cover how AI is expected to influence their software's user experience and future development.
	Presentation Insights: Tom indicated that the presentation will provide insights into the changes driven by AI, particularly in how customers will engage with their software. This is part of a broader initiative from the DX group outside of Workfront.
Scheduling Challenges: 
Tom apologized for missing one-on-one meetings with team members due to scheduling conflicts and upcoming events like QBR, Hackfront, and their vacation. They encouraged team members to reach out via Slack if they needed assistance.
	Missed One-on-Ones: Tom apologized for missing one-on-one meetings with team members due to various scheduling conflicts. He acknowledged the challenges posed by time off and overlapping schedules.
	Upcoming Events: Tom highlighted upcoming events such as QBR, Hackfront, and his vacation, which will further impact his availability. He encouraged team members to reach out via Slack if they needed assistance during this period.
Game Performance: 
Tom and Craig noted that the game performance had improved, making it more playable. However, they acknowledged that the biggest issue remaining was the game skipping turns in the middle, which they considered a deal-breaker.
	Improved Playability: Tom and Craig observed that the game performance had improved, making it more playable compared to previous versions. They appreciated the progress made in enhancing the game's stability.
	Turn Skipping Issue: Despite the improvements, Tom and Craig identified the turn skipping issue as a major problem. The game sometimes skips a player's turn in the middle, which they considered a deal-breaker that needs urgent attention.
